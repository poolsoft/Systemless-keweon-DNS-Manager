### Do you need to pay something or register?

NO. There is no need to register and you don't need to pay for it. There is a vision for keweon and that vision will stay. Here it is too much to explain all of these but more will comming soon on the website www.keweon.de and www.keweon.com.

### What kind of data keweon will collect?

Not even one byte of anything, of you or of your device(s). That was the main problem for all investors. With DNS technologie it is even not possible to collect any data from users. That was also the main reason why everything is DNS based.
